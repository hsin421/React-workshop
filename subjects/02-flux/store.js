/**
 * Flux Explanation of Store:
 * Stores contain the application state and logic. Their role is somewhat similar to a model in a traditional MVC, but
 * they manage the state of many objects. Nor are they the same as Backbone's collections. More than simply managing a
 * collection of ORM-style objects, stores manage the application state for a particular domain within the application.
 *
 * A store registers itself with the dispatcher and provides it with a callback. This callback receives a data payload
 * as a parameter. The payload contains an action with an attribute identifying the action's type. Within the store's
 * registered callback, a switch statement based on the action's type is used to interpret the payload and to provide the
 * proper hooks into the store's internal methods. This allows an action to result in an update to the state of the store,
 * via the dispatcher. After all the stores are updated, they broadcast an event declaring that their state has changed,
 * so the views may query the new state and update themselves.
 *
 * Alt Implementation of Stores:
 * These are the stores returned by alt.createStore, they will not have the methods defined in your StoreModel because flux
 * stores do not have direct setters. However, any static methods defined in your StoreModel will be transferred to this object.
 *
 * Please note: Static methods defined on a store model are nothing more than synthetic sugar for exporting the method as a public
 * method of your alt instance. This means that `this` will be bound to the store instance. It is recommended to explicitly export
 * the methods in the constructor using StoreModel#exportPublicMethods.
 *
